## Configuration Stuffs Form Exercise

Using the Foundation UI framework to build a little form component.

Using the Foundation CLI, needed to use the ZURB template (not the basic template to get abide feature to work). So the src code is somewhat over kill for a little component demo... but should continue to serve as a solid playground for continuing to develop and test out components.

Features form validation with errors using Foundation's "abide" feature, overriding the default HTML5 form validation. Simply a required field validation checking only on the secret code input field as an example. Really should give user an indication of what is required before failing on the submit button of course.

Still to improve the Radio select options, not really happy with the markup, and there is an un-clickable area between the radio and the label. Needs fixing.

Cancel button just runs a little script to clear and reset the form.
